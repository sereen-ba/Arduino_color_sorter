# Arduino_color_sorter
All we need for this Arduino project is one color sensor (TCS3200) and a servo motors.
________________
This code state each object color, and sort it using the servo motor arm through moving the arm in those three angles [90,180,270]
according to the reading of the TCS3200 --> [colored,white ,black]
